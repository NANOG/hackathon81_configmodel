# hackathon81_configmodel
NANOG 81 Hackathon - Configuration Modeling

This is a sample project to serve as a basic configuration modeling and software design tutorial.

The code is intended for educational purposes only and is in no way intended for production use.

## What's in this directory
This is the `hack` directory, which contains a skeleton to get you started.

If you're looking for a basic, working system to expand upon, you probably want to be looking at the [basic-working](../basic-working) directory.

## Getting started with your environment
1. Git
   1. Click the `Fork` button at https://github.com/NANOG/hackathon81_configmodel
   2. On your machine:
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com:{YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME}/hackathon81_configmodel.git
      ```
2. Python virtual environments (see Cheatsheet selection below)

## Getting started with the code
Once you have your environment set up (see the Cheatsheet section below) it's time to consider the basic directory layout
```text
hack/
├── run.py <- run the app (no need to change this)
├── tests/ <- your unit tests
└── configmodel/
    ├── schemas <- your json schemas
    ├── templates <- your mako templates
    ├── logic/ <- your business logic
    ├── database/ <- your database models
    └── api/   
        └── namespaces/
            ├── __init__.py <- add your namespaces here (otherwise no need to change this)
            ├── hello.py <- example namespace
            └── ... <- your namespaces
```

## Creating a basic system
1. Create interface and BGP peer configuration schemas
2. Create templates for interface and BGP peer configuration rendering for two vendors
3. Create a RESTful API
4. Add logic to create backbone link and PNI services
5. Add a database
 
## Cheatsheet
Here's a shortcut for making virtual environments (put this in, say, `~/bin/mkvenv`)
```shell
#!/bin/bash

if [ -e ./venv ]
then
    echo "venv already exists"
else
    echo "creating ./venv..."
    cwd=`basename \`pwd\``
    virtualenv venv --prompt "($cwd) " --python=python3.8
fi
```

Then create a virtual environment and activate it
```shell
mkvenv
source venv/bin/activate
````

And deactivate it later with
```shell
deactivate
```

Install Python packages
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
python setup.py develop
```

Before committing code
```shell
tox
```
